### **Key Elements:**
1. Push Button Input – Detects button presses to increase the counter.
2. Debounce Mechanism – Ensures accurate button press detection.
3. LCD Display (I2C) – Displays the count value dynamically.
4. LED Indication – Blinks when the button is pressed for user feedback.
5. Arduino UNO – Controls the logic and processes button inputs.
4. Arduino UNO – Controls the logic and processes button inputs.

### **Technology Used:**
1. Arduino UNO  – Microcontroller for processing inputs and outputs.
